Hello there, my name is Cheick Kante, Discord Username : TM Cheick K.

I live in New York, and am studying Electrical Engineering.


I made a couple of websites for artist friends and a very basic app, just to assess myself. I don't feel 100% confident in knowing the essentials when it comes to putting different technologies together to get a job done, but I'm getting there.


I aspire to become a skilled software developper.
I've been teaching myself Software Development for almost a year. I know how crucial understanding the basics, can affect one's career for the better so I like to play around with different tools and explore different ways of getting tasks done.
